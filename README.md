# Front React

Frontend React, Redux, and ES6 JS

## Why Learn React?

React is a popular forward thinking framework. React is an evolution of the MVC architecture 
that is common in many programming languages. React focusses on creating reusable components 
that work with a unidirectional data flow. React solves many of the problems found in complex UI.

Redux is an extension to Rect that manages Application state/data using functional programming 
concepts. 

Here is what the React developers have to say about 
React:

Here are a few more reasons you would want to learn React:

- Client side rendering has advantages.
    - Avoids unnecessary server requests.
    - Supports lazy loading, loads assets as needed.
- React is about building user interfaces from reusable components. 
- Expect to see React at some larger companies you may work for in the future. 
- React uses ES6 the latest iteration of the JavaScript language. Learning React is a great way to 
expand your knowledge of JavaScript.

## Goals

This class will take the form of lessons that students can **follow at their own pace.** Rather than
weekly course material all of the material will be presented at the beginning of the course. Students 
will be encouraged to work through the material in sections. Each section will be followed up by a 
series of challenges. Students can self assess their own knowledge of the material by solving the 
challenges. 

Ideally students will solve all of the challenges before moving on to a new section!

## Competencies

- Create single page applications with React.
- Build reusable components with React.

## Lesson Outline 

1. Check your JavaScript Skills
    - Short review of JavaScript with a focus on JS skills that apply to React.
    - [JavaScript intro and review](./01-js-review-concepts/)
2. ES6 new JavaScript syntax
    - Short introduction to ES6 the latest version of the JavaScript language.  
    - [ES6 Concepts](./02-es6-concepts)
3. React intro to Components
    - Introduction to basic React concepts. Components are the basic building blocks used in React.
    - [React Components intro](./03-react-intro) 
4. React tutorial 
    - Working with React Components Simple Components, Smart Components, state, and props. 
    This tutorial covers using Components to build an interactive application with React. It also 
    cover
    - [React Tutorial](./04-react-tutorial)
5. Webpack
    - A short tutorial on using Webpack. Webpack is a module bundler, this is a tool that manages 
    and bundles your files and their dependancies. Bundling files collects code and builds a single
    JS file containing your production code. Webpack is also a task runner that can process CSS, 
    run your local dev server and more. 
    - [Webpack Tutorial](./05-webpack-intro)
6. React Router
    - React Router is a routing library for React. Routing allows you to create multi-page sites 
    with React where the content displayed is linked to the URL in the address bar. 
    - [React Router](./06-react-router)
7. Redux 
    - Redux is library for managing application state. Redux uses fucntional programming concepts.  
    - [Redux](./07-redux) 
8. Middleware 
    - Learn about using middleware to handle asynchronous data along with applcation state and Redux. 
    - [Middleware](./08-middleware)
9. Redux Thunk 
    - Use Thunk, a middleware for Redux, to handle your async requests. 
    - [Redux Thunk](./09-redux-thunk)
10. Redux Local Storage
    - [Redux Local Storage](./10-redux-localstorage)
