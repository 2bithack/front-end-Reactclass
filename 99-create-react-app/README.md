# Create React App  

This is an aleternative build that doesn't use Webpack. 

This looks like a good tutorial. It would probably be good for someone that wanted to really 
understand React. If you are interested in making front end components with React, and want to get
a better understanding of many of the more subtle features of React do watch these video and build 
the examples. 

The starter project used in Create React App is very good. It comes with more default code than the 
other boilerplate/starter projects. Even if you aren't interested in doing these tutorials, it is 
worth your time to try out this boilerplate project if you are looking for a better starter project. 

> I had trouble installing create-react-app something to do with my bash path. I was unable to solve 
> this with the command line. I was able to download the project and run `npm install` to get it 
> working.
