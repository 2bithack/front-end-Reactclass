## Project Ideas

- Make a Blog with Gatsby
    - https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby
- Make a really complete Tic Tac Toe game
    - While not a great "product" this would be a great platform for learning. Add these features:
        - Use Router to create several "pages" for Game, Instructions, scores etc. 
        - Modify the game play. Try making connect 4 or other grid based game. 
        - Look closely at the components and think of how you can best abstract these. 
        - Use Redux to hold the game state. 
        - Use Firebase or other service: 
            - Add user login
            - Keep track of high scores
            - Make it two player
